This was my capstone project for my Master's of Engineering. The goal of this project was to create a rapidly deployable tactical mesonet (RDTM) which is essentially a sensor network that can be deployed during a wildfire to provide localized data that can help alert firefighters when there are wind changes and how they should react to the fire.
My team and I worked on this project for 6 months and took it from a loose concept through two prototypes and finished at a point where the nodes were ready for small scale testing. The first prototype used a raspberry pi and had limited sensors and no network capability so I'll just be talking about the second prototype here.

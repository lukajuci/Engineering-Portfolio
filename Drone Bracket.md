# Drone Bracket
## Description

The goal of this school project was to design a bracket that could be used to carry packages via drone. Specific requirements were that we had to follow OSHA 29 CFR 1926.251(a)(4), the brackets must be able to support a 20 pound load, the maximum size, and the holes had to be in a specific location. The goal was to minimize cost and weight for the bracket while being able to 3d print it. Starting with a simple block braket I used SOLIDWORKS to iterate and minimize certain dimensions while still being able to pass the strength test. In the end the bracket failed at 45 pounds so it had a factor of safety of over 2 but wasn't over engineered. Pictures can be seen below of the first design, final design, and simulated stress test.
